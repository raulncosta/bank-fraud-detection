# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

## Introduction

The continuous increase in online banking transactions has brought a significant rise in fraudulent activities. These frauds not only lead to direct financial losses for consumers and financial institutions but also undermine trust in the digital banking system as a whole. Against this backdrop, proactive fraud detection becomes a critical necessity.

This data science portfolio project aims to tackle this issue by developing a machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent bank transactions. Utilizing a dataset comprising both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the project follows a rigorous methodological approach, involving:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** An initial investigation to understand the data distribution, identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to improve the quality and effectiveness of the machine learning model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation:** Testing various machine learning algorithms to find the most effective model for fraud detection.
- **Model Optimization and Validation:** Fine-tuning the chosen model and validating its performance.

### Objectives

- Develop a robust predictive model that can identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and a low false positive rate;
- Provide insights into the features that most contribute to fraud detection.
